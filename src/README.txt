Developers - Ethan Hamman, Brendan Petras, Conlan Hanwell

Welcome to Tunnel Invaders! You are Astronaut Andy, a brave lad from
the planet Argonn-9. When out on your daily supply run you decide to
take a detour through the dangerous tunnels of an asteroid. It doesn't
look like there's a possible escape, but desperate to not turn back,
you decide to go through. You must avoid crashes with walls and obstacles and
pick up power-ups for more points and ammo. Good luck Andy.

Command, over and out.
================================================================

Design of our game comes from similar tunnel runner games.
Controls & design:
-Move in all 4 directions
-Fire bullets
-Power-ups add 1 bullet and 20 points, advancing you through levels faster
-Crashing into terrain, walls, or falling obstacles ends the game
Features:
-3 different generation algorithms for the 3 levels
	-Sub levels contain more extreme versions of generation
-Randomness in level 2 generation and item spawns (obstacles/power-ups)
-Fully functional and responsive hit detection of the ship as well as bullets
-Joystick controls
-Cheat code -- Press down instead of fire to remove hit detection (for easier marking)
